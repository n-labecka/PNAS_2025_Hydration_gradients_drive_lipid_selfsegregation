Article: Labecka et al. Hydration gradients drive lipid self-segregation, PNAS, 2026. 
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2518553123. 

The GitHub repository https://github.com/n-labecka/PNAS_2025_Hydration_gradients_drive_lipid_selfsegregation contains raw and processed data sets and codes which were used to construct the figures in the main article. The data set in SI as calibration curve and phase diagram data is not provided. 

The data files for DOPC and DPPC lipid mixtures can be found under Releases v1.0 in the repository, while the processing codes are attached in the folders Confocal Raman Data_DOPCDPPC2080 and SAXS and WAXS plotting. Additional files describing the codes and experimental conditions will be generated and added accordingly. Zendo archive with the data sets used in the main article will also be created and DOI will be provided in this file.
